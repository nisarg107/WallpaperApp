# wallpaperapp

I have built a wallpaper app using Flutter, a framework known for beautiful user interfaces. To fuel the app with stunning visuals, I have integrated the Pexels API, granting access to a vast library of high-quality wallpapers. This allows users to browse through a wide variety of images and set them as their device wallpaper directly within the app.
